### Group Project Planning
We will have time allotted each day this week to work on group project planning!


***You will be required to have 4 features for this project, 2 full CRUD and 2 partial CRUD***

You must produce 5 design documents for approval by your project advisor before beginning:
- Feature list
- User stories
- Database schema
- Scrum/Kanban Board
- Project Scorecard


---



## Steps to Get Started on the Project

1. Come up with an idea for your project with your group and create a Feature List for Instructor approval. Make sure to get instructor approval on your feature list before continuing on with your other design docs.
2. Start an empty git repository WITHOUT a readme and create a wiki in your repo to hold all of your design docs. Share your wiki with your project advisor.
3. The project starter repo will be released when 5 design docs have been approved, or next Thursday at the latest. Do not start coding until this is released AND you have finished your design docs!

## Optional Design Docs

You do not need to follow this schedule exactly! We prefer to you to take time with your planning - it is ok to turn in your docs after their "due" dates.

Submit your design docs for review by tagging your project lead in your group slack channel with a link to your GitHub wiki page.

Redux State Shape, API routes, Frontend Routes, and Wire Frames are optional but might be helpful!

### Group Projects
You are free to choose between cloning an existing app, creating your own, or something in between!

You must use the Python project starter code.

You must have 4 MVP features - at least 2 of which must be full CRUD features.

You may use packages and modules not covered by the App Academy curriculum (React libraries, Flask libraries, etc.), but CSS libraries are not permitted for this project.
